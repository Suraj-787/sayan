FARMERS WELFARE 
Chapter 
1. PRADHAN MANTRI FASAL BIMA YOJANA (PMFBY) 
● It was launched in 2016, making it the third largest insurance scheme globally in terms of premium and shields 
farmers from crop loss or damage arising from unforeseen events. 
● The scheme replaced the existing two schemes National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) as well as 
the Modified  NAIS  and  there  will  be  exemption  from  Service  Tax  liability  of  all  the  services  involved  in  the  
implementation of the scheme. 
OBJECTIVES 
● To provide  insurance  coverage and financial  support  to  the  farmers in  the  event  of  failure  of  any  of  the  
notified crops as a result of natural calamities, pests & diseases. 
● To stabilise the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming. 
● To encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices. 
● To ensure flow of credit to the agriculture sector. 
FEATURES OF THE SCHEME 
● Coverage of farmers: The scheme covers loanee farmers (those who have taken a loan), non-loanee farmers 
(on a voluntary basis), tenant farmers, and sharecroppers. 
● Coverage of Crops: Every state has notified crops (major crops) for the Rabi and Kharif seasons. The premium 
rates differ across seasons.  
● Premium  Rates: There  will  be  a  uniform  premium  of  only  2%  to  be  paid  by  farmers  for  all  Kharif  crops  and  
1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers 
will be only 5%.  
○ The difference between the premium rate and the rate of Insurance charges payable by farmers shall 
be treated as Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally by the Centre and State. 
○ There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if the balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by 
the Government.  
● Area-Based Insurance Unit: The PMFBY operates on an area approach. Thus, all farmers in a particular area 
must pay the same premium and have the same claim payments. The area approach reduces the risk of moral 
hazard and adverse selection.  
● Coverage of Risks: Following risks leading to crop loss are to be covered under the scheme: 
○ Yield  losses  due  to  non-preventable  risks,  such  as  Natural  Fire  and  Lightning;  Storm,  Hailstorm,  Cyclone,  
Typhoon, Tempest, Hurricane, Tornado etc.; Flood, Inundation and Landslide; Drought, Dry spells and Pests/ 
Diseases etc. 
○ Prevented sowing: In cases where majority of the insured farmers of a notified area, having intent to sow 
but are prevented from sowing the insured crop due to adverse weather conditions.  
○ Post-Harvest losses against perils of cyclones, unseasonal rains throughout the country. 
○ Localised  Calamities:  Loss  resulting  from  occurrence  of  identified  localised  risks  i.e.  hailstorm,  landslide, 
and Inundation affecting isolated farms in the notified area. 
● Innovative Technology Use: It recommends the use of technology such as using drones to reduce the use of 
crop cutting experiments (CCEs), which are traditionally used to estimate crop loss; and using mobile phones to 
reduce delays in claim settlements by uploading crop- cutting data on apps/online.

• Implementation: INFLIBNET Centre (Information and Library Network Centre) in Gandhinagar. It is an Inter-
University Centre of the University Grants Commission under the Ministry of Education.  
• Scheme operation from: January 1, 2025. 
• Conceptualization: The  initiative  stems  from  the  National  Education  Policy  (NEP)  2020,  which  emphasised  
research  as  a  critical  pillar  for  achieving  excellence  in  education  and  national  development.  ONOS  aims  to  
democratise access to knowledge and promote research in India. 
CURRENT MECHANISM FOR JOURNAL ACCESS 
• HEIs  currently  access  journals  through  10  different  library  consortia,  under  the  administrative  control of 
various ministries.

Chapter 
1. NATIONAL ONE HEALTH MISSION 
ABOUT ONE HEALTH 
• One Health is an integrating idea that brings different sectors together to solve the health, productivity, and 
conservation challenges and has major implications for India.  
• India with its diverse wildlife, one of the largest livestock populations and high density of human population, 
carries heightened risks for inter-compartmental spread of diseases.  
ABOUT NATIONAL ONE HEALTH MISSION 
• Launched in 2022. 
• The goal is to develop strategies for integrated disease surveillance, joint outbreak response, coordinated 
research  and  development  (R&D)  and  ensure  seamless  information  sharing  for  better  control  of  routine  
diseases as well as those of a pandemic nature.  
• It will help India to achieve integrated disease control and pandemic preparedness by institutionalizing the One 
Health approach. 
 
• Under  the  mission,  a  national  network  of  high-risk  pathogen  (Biosafety  level  or  BSL  3  and  BSL  4)  
laboratories has been created.  
• Under  the  mission,  efforts  are  being  made  to  apply  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning  and  
disease modelling to address these issues and coordinate capacity building in epidemiology across sectors.  
• Emerging  approaches  such  as  genomic  surveillance  from  wastewater  showed  promise  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.  This  will  be  expanded  to  other  sentinels  such  as  places  where  animals  (livestock  or  wildlife)  
congregate for a broader set of diseases to be taken up so that we mainstream these approaches to be a part 
of routine surveillance across human, livestock and environmental sectors. 
• 13  Ministries  and  Departments  as  well  as  science  funding  agencies  such  as  Department  Of  Science  and  
Technology, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the 
Department of Pharmaceuticals, and AYUSH, the Ministries of Health, Animal Husbandry and Environment as 

MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE  
 
RAU’S IAS PRELIMS COMPASS 2024 | GOVERNMENT SCHEMES 
36 
 
well as Defence came together to shape the mission, taking one of the most holistic approaches to one health 
and pandemic preparedness in the world. 
• While diseases that affect humans such as COVID-19,  diseases  that  affect  animals  such  as  foot  and  mouth  
disease  or  lumpy  skin  disease can  hit  productivity  and  trade.  Similarly,  these  and  other  diseases  such  as  
canine  distemper  affect  wild  animals  and  their  conservation.  Only  a  coordinated  approach  is  essential  to  
enhance readiness for prevalent diseases and potential pandemic threats like avian influenza or Nipah. 
• Pandemic preparedness is incomplete without there being a focus on strong R&D. Focused R&D efforts are 
crucial  for  enhancing  preparedness  against  emerging  diseases  by  creating  essential  tools  like  vaccines, 
therapeutics, and diagnostics, which are vital for both India and the global community.  
 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ONE HEALTH (NIOH) 
• It is being set up in Nagpur, Maharashtra. 
• It is part of a National One Health Mission. 
• The institute will focus on a ‘One Health’ approach, recognizing the interconnectedness between human, animal, 
and environmental health. This approach is crucial for tackling zoonotic diseases, which can jump from animals 
to humans. 
• The director of NIOH will serve as the mission director for the multi-ministerial and multi-sectoral National One 
Health  Mission  for  integrated  disease  control  and  pandemic  preparedness  by  bringing  human,  animal,  plant  
and environmental sectors together.  
2. AYUSHMAN CARD 
• The National Health Authority (NHA) issues the Ayushman card, which offers access to a network of public and 
private hospitals across India.  
• The health cards are given to the beneficiaries' families and individuals. The family health folders are kept at 
the Health Wellness Centres (HWC) or nearby Primary Healthcare Centres (PHC) in paper and/or digital format. 
• Beneficiaries can use this card to avail cashless treatment and hospitalisation at these network hospitals.  
• This ensures that every family knows their entitlement to healthcare through both HWC and the Pradhan Mantri 
Jan Arogya Yojana or equivalent health schemes of state and central government.  
• Aadhar card is not mandatory for availing services under this scheme.

through a convergence of central and state schemes.  
• The program aims to address the economic, social, and developmental gaps in these districts and unlock their 
potential for growth and development.  
BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAMME 
• It is a collective effort of the central and state governments. 
• At  the  Central  level,  NITI  Aayog  is  steering  the  implementation  of  this  initiative.  Additionally,  individual  
Ministries have assumed responsibilities to drive the progress of the districts. 
• The States have either formed a committee under their respective Chief Secretaries or appointed a nodal 
officer to implement as well as to track the programme.  
• To  create  policy  convergence  and  promote  collaboration  across  all  levels  of  the  government  a  Central  and  
State Prabhari Officer has been nominated at central and state level of government for each district. 
• To  ensure  the  convergence  in  schemes  and  address  specific  issues  and  challenges  that  are  raised  by  the  
Prabhari Officers, an Empowered Committee has been set up under the chairmanship of the CEO, NITI Aayog.

• The programme focuses on 3Cs (convergence, collaboration, and competition) to improve the effectiveness 
of the schemes. 
• The Aspirational Blocks strategy hinges upon three broad contours: 
o Convergence  (of  Central  &  State  Schemes),  Collaboration  (between  NITI  Aayog,  Central  Ministries,  State  
Departments,  District  &  Block  Administration)  and,  Competition  among  blocks  driven  by  a  spirit  of  mass  
Movement. 
• It aims to address all other indicators in the six thematic areas to bring a holistic change in these districts. 
• Measurability of progress is key as all data on progress are live on the Champions  of  Change  portal  where 
rankings of each district against each thematic area are made public.  
• This evaluation also highlights the best practices implemented by some districts which can be replicated in other 
districts. 
• Apart  from  creating  services  and  maintaining  accessibility,  behavioural  insights  are  being  applied  in  the  
aspirational districts to aid the uptake of services and create impactful behavioural change among the target 
populations improving outcomes.
